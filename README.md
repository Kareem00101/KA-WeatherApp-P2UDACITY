# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project is used to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
In this project I used a weather API from https://openweathermap.org/api so that we can the weather data.
This project was made for Udacity Front-End Nano-Degree Program submissions.

## More Details
In the server.js we set up our express app, port, server and handle the routes.
In the app.js we will setup some dynamic functions, and most importantly everything related to the weather API.
The HTML-CSS has almost no changes compared to the template provided by Udacity.

## Useful Resources
### special thanks:
First thanks for the Udacity Nano-degree front-end development program, i was able to learn many things from it.
Note: I never copied from these resources, they were just used as a review of how is the project is supposed to act like and to help understand somethings.
